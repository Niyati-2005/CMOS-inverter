## CMOS Inverter using FinFET - Project README

### 📘 Abstract

In this report, a CMOS inverter is characterized using advanced FinFET technology at the 7nm node. With aggressive device scaling, conventional planar MOSFETs encounter performance degradation due to increased leakage current and short channel effects. FinFETs, with their multi-gate 3D structure, provide better electrostatic control, reduced leakage, and superior current drive capabilities.

The inverter was simulated in HSPICE, and timing parameters such as **tpHL**, **tpLH**, **trise**, and **tfall** were extracted, along with **average power dissipation**. Results were compared with a conventional MOSFET-based inverter to highlight the efficiency and performance benefits of FinFET technology.
